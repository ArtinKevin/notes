##### **[Nevanlinna value distribution theory with its applications and generalizations](毕业论文1.pdf)** _Update: May 12, 2022_
This is a survy.I wrote it for my senior thesis in college.It aims to introduce the basic Nevanlinna value distribution theory with its applications and generalizations,including three parts: classical theory and its applications in function theory,the generalization of value distribution theory in high-dimensional complex manifolds,the relationship between value distribution theory and Diophantine approximation.
##### **[Basic dimension theory in commutative algebra](basic dimension theory.pdf)** _Update: June 3, 2022_
This is a note to introduce dimension theory in commutative algebra.It closely follow Matsumura’s book and Atiyah’s book on commutative algebra.
