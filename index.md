##### **[Nevanlinna value distribution theory with its applications and generalizations](毕业论文1.pdf)** 
This is a survy.I wrote it for my senior thesis in college.It aims to introduce the basic Nevanlinna value distribution theory with its applications and generalizations,including three parts: classical theory and its applications in function theory,the generalization of value distribution theory in high-dimensional complex manifolds,the relationship between value distribution theory and Diophantine approximation.

##### **[Basic dimension theory in commutative algebra](dimension%20theory.pdf)** 
This is a short note to introduce dimension theory in commutative algebra.It closely follow Matsumura’s book and Atiyah’s book on commutative algebra. I also use it to give a lecture on the seminar class of the commutative algebra.Update: June 3, 2022
##### **[Derivations and Kähler differentials](derivation.pdf)** 
This is a short note to introduce derivations and Kähler differentials.It includes basic properties of derivations and Kähler differentials,characterization of field extensions in terms of differential calculus and a proof of Hochschild's identity about derivations in positive characteristic commutative rings.
